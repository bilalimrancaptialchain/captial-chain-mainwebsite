    "title": "Trading Behaviour and Rules",
    "content": "<p>We offer Capital Chain Evaluation Programs in both Two-Phase and One-Phase models, each available in Normal and Atomic versions. To become a Master trader (funded trader), you must successfully pass the evaluation stage(s). It is crucial that you demonstrate a consistent trading system and strong risk management in order to pass. After you reach your profit target, your entire evaluation period will be manually reviewed by our Risk Team. This review process will be completed within two working days.</p><br /> <p>In the event of a breach of any of the rules referred to in this section, all positions on the platform shall be closed immediately, the Customer’s Account will be closed, and the right to any reward will be revoked.</p><br /> <p><strong>2.1. The Student Phase (Two-Phase – Phase I)</strong></p> <p>The Student Phase is designed to test your trading skills while defining your style as a trader. During the Student Phase, you must achieve a profit target of <strong>8%</strong> (e.g., $4,000 on a $50,000 account) without breaching any other rule and complete at least <strong>4 minimum trading days</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Normal 2-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 8%, Maximum Loss Limit = 10%, Daily Loss Limit = 5%</li> <li><strong>Atomic 2-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 8%, Maximum Loss Limit = 12%, Daily Loss Limit = 5%</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>2.2. The Practitioner Phase (Two-Phase – Phase II)</strong></p> <p>The Practitioner Phase is designed to confirm the results and outcomes of the Student Phase. During this phase, you must achieve a profit target of <strong>5%</strong> without breaching any other rule and complete at least <strong>4 minimum trading days</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Normal 2-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 5%, Maximum Loss Limit = 10%, Daily Loss Limit = 5%</li> <li><strong>Atomic 2-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 5%, Maximum Loss Limit = 12%, Daily Loss Limit = 5%</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>2.3. One-Phase Model (Normal/Atomic)</strong></p> <p>In the One-Phase model, the trader must achieve a profit target of <strong>10%</strong> (e.g., $5,000 on a $50,000 account) with a minimum of <strong>4 trading days</strong> while respecting all other rules.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Normal 1-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 10%, Maximum Loss Limit = 6%, Daily Loss Limit = 3%</li> <li><strong>Atomic 1-Step Evaluation:</strong> Profit Target = 10%, Maximum Loss Limit = 7%, Daily Loss Limit = 3%</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>2.4. Maximum Daily Loss Limit</strong></p> <p>The Maximum Daily Loss is the amount the trader is allowed to lose in a single day. For this rule, the higher value between equity and balance will be used:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Two-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 5% of starting equity/balance.</li> <li><strong>One-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 3% of starting equity/balance.</li> </ul> <p><em>Example:</em> For a $100,000 account under the Two-Phase Normal model, the maximum daily loss is $5,000. For the Atomic Two-Phase model, the maximum daily loss is also 5% ($5,000). The equity of the day — which is the result of the currently floating PnL combined with all closed positions of that day — must not exceed this limit. The limit resets at 00:00 CE(S)T/server time each day.</p><br /> <p><strong>2.6. News Trading and Holding Over the Weekend</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>During the Evaluation (Student/Practitioner/One-Phase):</strong> You are allowed to hold trades over the weekend and trade during news events without restrictions.</li> <li><strong>During the Master Stage:</strong> News trading and holding positions overnight or over the weekend are fully allowed on all Capital Chain Master accounts. There are no restrictions on profits generated around high-impact news events.</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>2.7. Trading Strategy</strong></p> <p>You may trade the way you want. You are free to use Expert Advisors (EAs), hold during news, keep trades over the weekend, and trade lot sizes as large as leverage allows — as long as the trading activity does not fall under the prohibited categories:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gap Trading:</strong> Entering trades immediately at market open to exploit weekend or session price gaps without any analytical basis. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD at the Sunday open solely because of a 20-pip gap.</li> <br><li><strong>High-Frequency Trading (HFT):</strong> Using algorithms or systems to place a very large number of trades within milliseconds to exploit execution speed. <em>Example:</em> Submitting hundreds of buy/sell orders in under a second to capture micro-ticks.</li> <br><li><strong>Server Spamming:</strong> Overloading the trading server with excessive order requests or modifications in a short period. <em>Example:</em> Repeatedly opening and closing dozens of orders per second to test latency or disrupt execution.</li> <br><li><strong>Latency Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting differences between the Company’s price feed and another broker or data source. <em>Example:</em> Buying GBPUSD on Capital Chain when a faster feed shows higher prices elsewhere, solely to profit from the feed delay.</li> <br><li><strong>Toxic Trading Flow:</strong> As defined in Section 3.</li> <br><li><strong>Hedging Across Multiple Accounts:</strong> Opening opposing trades on two or more different accounts to eliminate risk. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD on one funded account and selling the same size on another account to guarantee one profit regardless of direction. (Internal hedging within a single account is allowed.)</li> <br><li><strong>Reverse Arbitrage (Long-Short Arbitrage Simultaneously):</strong> Taking opposite positions on correlated instruments or brokers to exploit minor discrepancies. <em>Example:</em> Going long on US30 while going short on a correlated index solely to capture mispricing differences.</li> <br><li><strong>Tick Scalping:</strong> Opening and closing trades within seconds to exploit tiny bid/ask movements without strategy. <em>Example:</em> Opening 50 trades within one minute on XAUUSD to capture 0.1 pip movements repeatedly.</li> <br><li><strong>Copy Trading or Third-Party Account Management:</strong> Using another trader’s signals or managing external accounts by copying trades into Capital Chain accounts. <em>Example:</em> Mirroring trades from a master account on a different broker.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Important:</strong> Use of Expert Advisors (EAs) or trading robots is allowed only on the MetaTrader platform and solely when implementing your own personal trading strategy. Any EA or robot used for other purposes, including fully automated trading without personal strategy input, is prohibited and may lead to account closure.</p><br /> <p><strong>2.8. Preventing Gambler-Style Trading</strong></p> <p>At Capital Chain, our core mission is to invest in professional traders who demonstrate superior capital management and discipline. We seek sustainable profitability, not irrational risk-taking. This rule is put in place to shield our traders from excessive exposure and effectively filter out behaviors associated with gambling. Our fundamental purpose is to find and invest in serious, professional traders with robust risk management frameworks.</p> <br> <p><strong>1. Policy on Anti-Gamble Trading (Loss Exposure Limit)</strong></p> <p>To enforce highly disciplined risk management and protect both the trader’s equity and the firm’s capital, a loss exposure limit equal to <strong>3% of the account’s Equity</strong> is imposed. At any given time, the cumulative unrealized losses from all open positions must not, under any circumstance, exceed 3% of the current account Equity.</p> <br><p><strong>Definitions &amp; Applicability</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Equity-based Measure:</strong> This limit is calculated relative to the current account Equity (Balance ± Floating P&amp;L), ensuring real-time risk assessment.</li> <li><strong>Live Aggregated Loss:</strong> The measure is based on the sum of the live, real-time unrealized losses across all concurrent open trades.</li> <li><strong>Clarification:</strong> This rule does not restrict your profits or withdrawals; it only limits simultaneous excessive exposure.</li> </ul> <br><p><strong>Intentional Breach – Escalating Penalties</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>First Intentional Breach:</strong> The trader will receive a formal Disciplinary Warning, and all open positions will be closed immediately by the system.</li> <li><strong>Second Breach:</strong> The Challenge or Funded Account will be terminated or failed.</li> </ul> <br><p><strong>Rationale and Purpose</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Discouraging Gambling:</strong> This rule explicitly prevents reckless, high-margin exposure in single or aggregated trades. We are looking for professional, consistent traders, not speculators.</li> <li><strong>Encouraging Professional Sizing:</strong> It enforces disciplined trade sizing and risk assessment on every trade idea.</li> <li><strong>Ensuring Account Longevity:</strong> By capping losses, we insulate the trading capital from sudden adverse market movements, promoting consistent, risk-conscious behavior essential for long-term success.</li> </ul> <br><p><strong>Illustrative Examples of the 3% Anti-Gambling Rule</strong></p> <ul> <br><li><strong>Example 1 – Single Trade Violation:</strong> Account Equity = $20,000. Trader opens one position with a floating loss of $700. $700 ÷ $20,000 = 3.5%. → This exceeds the 3% threshold, triggering an immediate breach (first violation triggers a warning).</li> <br><li><strong>Example 2 – Multiple Trades Combined:</strong> Account Equity = $10,000. Trader opens 3 trades simultaneously: Trade 1: –$80, Trade 2: –$120, Trade 3: –$100. Total Unrealized Loss = $300. $300 ÷ $10,000 = 3%. → This exactly hits the limit, resulting in a breach (first violation triggers a warning).</li> <br><li><strong>Example 3 – Account Growth:</strong> Account Equity = $15,000 (after profits). Trader opens positions with a combined unrealized loss of $400. $400 ÷ $15,000 = 2.66%. → This is allowed since it remains under 3%. The limit dynamically adjusts based on current equity.</li> <br><li><strong>Example 4 – Account Decline:</strong> Account Equity = $8,000 (after losses). Trader opens trades with a combined unrealized loss of $240. $240 ÷ $8,000 = 3%. → The limit tightens as equity decreases. The breach occurs exactly at $240 in this scenario.</li> <br><li><strong>Example 5 – Risk Management in Action:</strong> Account Equity = $50,000. Trader sizes positions so that maximum risk per setup never exceeds $1,200. $1,200 ÷ $50,000 = 2.4%. → This demonstrates professional discipline and ensures the account remains compliant at all times.</li> </ul> <br><br> <p><strong>Remember!</strong> YOUR IDEAS, OUR RISK — To get funded and grow as a trader, you must demonstrate skill and discipline. You cannot cheat your way in.</p><br />"

  "toxicTradingFlow": {
    "title": "Toxic Trading Flow",
    "content": "<p><strong>3. Toxic Trading Flow</strong></p> <p>“Toxic Trading Flow” refers to trading behaviours that exploit loopholes, manipulate execution, or create unsustainable results that do not represent genuine skill. Capital Chain reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, whether trading activity constitutes toxic flow.</p><br /> <p><strong>Examples include, but are not limited to:</strong></p> <ul> <p><strong><br>The CapitalChain Policy Against Gambler-Style Account Allocation</strong></p><br /> <p>Our firm is built on investing in professional traders who demonstrate consistent skill and risk management. This policy ensures that all traders are assessed based on professional ability, not by leveraging multiple accounts to simply play the odds.</p><br /> <p><strong>Rule Overview: Account Rolling Prohibition</strong></p><br /> <p>At CapitalChain, while we permit trading across multiple accounts simultaneously, professional standards are in place to prevent Account Rolling behavior.</p><br /> <p><strong>What Constitutes Account Rolling?</strong></p><br /> <p>Account Rolling is the non-professional practice where a trader systematically uses one account as a &quot;sacrifice&quot; or a &quot;lottery ticket,&quot; while intentionally preserving another account to secure a pass or protect profits.</p><br /> <p>Specifically, this is a strict violation: If a trader abandons a losing account (by ceasing active trading) and immediately shifts focus to another account that had no prior activity during the same evaluation period, this is deemed Account Rolling. Such behavior compromises the integrity of the evaluation process and is strictly prohibited.</p><br /> <p><strong>✅ Allowed Practices (Professional Trading)</strong></p><br /> <ul> <li>A trader may hold multiple accounts, provided the Total Funded Allocation does not exceed 200,000.</li> <li>Traders may deploy one or multiple strategies across accounts, provided those strategies are applied consistently and simultaneously across all active accounts (i.e., all accounts must be managed actively and professionally).</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>❌ Strictly Prohibited Practices (Gambler-Style Trading)</strong></p><br /> <ul> <li><strong>Abandoning an Underperforming Account:</strong> Ceasing activity on a losing account to transfer focus to another inactive account.</li> <li><strong>The Sacrifice Method:</strong> Trading one account until it fails its drawdown limits, then immediately shifting focus to another active account.</li> <li><strong>Sequential Allocation:</strong> Using multiple accounts in sequence solely to increase the statistical probability of passing, rather than demonstrating consistent trading proficiency.</li> <li><strong>Treating Accounts as Lottery Tickets:</strong> Entering evaluations with the expectation that some will fail while one succeeds by chance.</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>Consequences of Violation</strong></p><br /> <p>Our commitment is to professional traders. Violations of this policy will result in the following disciplinary actions:</p><br /> <p><strong>Challenge Accounts:</strong><br /> <strong>Consequence:</strong> The Challenge will be invalidated and will not be considered passed.<br /> <strong>Rationale:</strong> This signifies a failure to demonstrate consistent risk control during the evaluation process.</p><br /> <p><strong>Live Funded Accounts:</strong><br /> <strong>Consequence:</strong> Profit withdrawals will be denied from the time the violation is detected.<br /> <strong>Rationale:</strong> This is due to the misuse of firm capital via an unprofessional account allocation strategy.</p><br /> <p><strong>Repeated Violations:</strong><br /> <strong>Consequence:</strong> Continuous or repeated Account Rolling behavior will result in the suspension or permanent termination of all active accounts with CapitalChain.<br /> <strong>Rationale:</strong> This reflects our zero tolerance policy for habitual, non-professional behavior.</p><br /> <p><strong>Purpose / Rationale</strong></p><br /> <p>This policy is critical to our investment strategy, as we only partner with disciplined professionals:</p><br /> <ul> <li><strong>Fairness and Integrity:</strong> Ensures all traders are evaluated against the same risk and performance standards, removing luck-based advantages.</li> <li><strong>Professionalism:</strong> Demands traders demonstrate consistent skill and risk management across all accounts, rejecting opportunistic gambling with account allocation.</li> <li><strong>Capital Protection:</strong> Prevents the misuse of CapitalChain's resources by eliminating speculative sacrificial or sequential account strategies.</li> </ul><br /> <li><strong>Gambling Behaviour:</strong> Trading decisions made without analysis or structured strategy, e.g., martingale or revenge trading. <br /> <em>Example:</em> After losing $2,000, a trader blindly doubles lot size to recover losses without a setup.</li> <li><strong>Overtrading:</strong> Opening an excessive number of trades in a day or week without a consistent system, often driven by emotion or FOMO.</li> <li><strong>Latency Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting delays between Capital Chain’s feed and another broker to profit from time differences. <br /> <em>Example:</em> EURUSD rises 10 pips faster on Broker A than on Capital Chain, and a trader instantly buys on Capital Chain to capture the lag.</li> <li><strong>Reverse Trading:</strong> Simultaneously opening opposing positions across multiple accounts to secure guaranteed profits. <br /> <em>Example:</em> Buying GBPUSD on one funded account and selling the same lot size on another.</li> <li><strong>Tick Scalping / High-Frequency Trading (HFT):</strong> Extremely short-term trades designed to exploit micro-latency. <br /> <em>Example:</em> 100 XAUUSD trades under 30 seconds each, targeting 0.1–0.3 pips.</li> <li><strong>External Account Management:</strong> Trading on behalf of others or mirroring across platforms. <br /> <em>Example:</em> Connecting a funded account to a trade-copying tool that executes trades from another broker’s master account.</li> </ul><br /> <p><strong>Consequences of Toxic Flow</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>First Offence:</strong> Warning and review by the Risk Team.</li> <li><strong>Second Offence:</strong> Immediate account closure, removal of profits, and permanent ban.</li> </ul><br />"
