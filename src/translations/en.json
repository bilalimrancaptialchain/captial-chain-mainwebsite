  "tradingBehaviourAndRules": {
    "title": "Trading Behaviour and Rules",
    "content": "<p>We offer Capital Chain Evaluation Programs in both Two-Phase and One-Phase models, each available in Normal and Atomic versions. To become a Master trader (funded trader), you must successfully pass the evaluation stage(s). It is crucial that you demonstrate a consistent trading system and strong risk management in order to pass. After you reach your profit target, your entire evaluation period will be manually reviewed by our Risk Team. This review process will be completed within two working days.</p><br/><p>In the event of a breach of any of the rules referred to in this section, all positions on the platform shall be closed immediately, the Customer’s Account will be closed, and the right to any reward will be revoked.</p><br/><p><strong>2.1. The Student Phase (Two-Phase – Phase I)</strong></p><p>The Student Phase is designed to test your trading skills while defining your style as a trader. During the Student Phase, you must achieve a profit target of <strong>8%</strong> (e.g., $4,000 on a $50,000 account) without breaching any other rule and complete at least <strong>4 minimum trading days</strong>.</p><br/><p><strong>2.2. The Practitioner Phase (Two-Phase – Phase II)</strong></p><p>The Practitioner Phase is designed to confirm the results and outcomes of the Student Phase. During this phase, you must achieve a profit target of <strong>5%</strong> without breaching any other rule and complete at least <strong>4 minimum trading days</strong>.</p><br/><p><strong>2.3. One-Phase Model (Normal/Atomic)</strong></p><p>In the One-Phase model, the trader must achieve a profit target of <strong>10%</strong> (e.g., $5,000 on a $50,000 account) with a minimum of <strong>4 trading days</strong> while respecting all other rules.</p><br/><p><strong>2.4. Maximum Daily Loss Limit</strong></p><p>The Maximum Daily Loss is the amount the trader is allowed to lose in a single day. For this rule, the higher value between equity and balance will be used:</p><ul><li><strong>Two-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 5% of starting equity/balance.</li><li><strong>One-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 3% of starting equity/balance.</li></ul><p><em>Example:</em> For a $100,000 account under the Two-Phase model, the maximum daily loss is $5,000. The equity of the day — which is the result of the currently floating PnL combined with all closed positions of that day — must not exceed this limit. The limit resets at 00:00 CE(S)T/server time each day.</p><br/><p><strong>2.6. News Trading and Holding Over the Weekend</strong></p><ul><li><strong>During the Evaluation (Student/Practitioner/One-Phase):</strong> You are allowed to hold trades over the weekend and trade during news events without restrictions.</li><li><strong>During the Master Stage:</strong> News trading and holding positions overnight or over the weekend are fully allowed on all Capital Chain Master accounts. There are no restrictions on profits generated around high-impact news events.</li></ul><br/><p><strong>2.7. Trading Strategy</strong></p><p>You may trade the way you want. You are free to use Expert Advisors (EAs), hold during news, keep trades over the weekend, and trade lot sizes as large as leverage allows — as long as the trading activity does not fall under the prohibited categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Gap Trading:</strong> Entering trades immediately at market open to exploit weekend or session price gaps without any analytical basis. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD at the Sunday open solely because of a 20-pip gap.</li><li><strong>High-Frequency Trading (HFT):</strong> Using algorithms or systems to place a very large number of trades within milliseconds to exploit execution speed. <em>Example:</em> Submitting hundreds of buy/sell orders in under a second to capture micro-ticks.</li><li><strong>Server Spamming:</strong> Overloading the trading server with excessive order requests or modifications in a short period. <em>Example:</em> Repeatedly opening and closing dozens of orders per second to test latency or disrupt execution.</li><li><strong>Latency Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting differences between the Company’s price feed and another broker or data source. <em>Example:</em> Buying GBPUSD on Capital Chain when a faster feed shows higher prices elsewhere, solely to profit from the feed delay.</li><li><strong>Toxic Trading Flow:</strong> As defined in Section 3.</li><li><strong>Hedging Across Multiple Accounts:</strong> Opening opposing trades on two or more different accounts to eliminate risk. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD on one funded account and selling the same size on another account to guarantee one profit regardless of direction. (Internal hedging within a single account is allowed.)</li><li><strong>Reverse Arbitrage (Long-Short Arbitrage Simultaneously):</strong> Taking opposite positions on correlated instruments or brokers to exploit minor discrepancies. <em>Example:</em> Going long on US30 while going short on a correlated index solely to capture mispricing differences.</li><li><strong>Tick Scalping:</strong> Opening and closing trades within seconds to exploit tiny bid/ask movements without strategy. <em>Example:</em> Opening 50 trades within one minute on XAUUSD to capture 0.1 pip movements repeatedly.</li><li><strong>Copy Trading or Third-Party Account Management:</strong> Using another trader’s signals or managing external accounts by copying trades into Capital Chain accounts. <em>Example:</em> Mirroring trades from a master account on a different broker.</li></ul><br/><p><strong>Important:</strong> Using a third-party Expert Advisor is allowed only if it functions purely as a trade/risk manager. Any other type of automated trading EA is not permitted and will result in account closure.</p><br/><p><strong>Remember!</strong> YOUR IDEAS, OUR RISK — To get funded and grow as a trader, you must demonstrate skill and discipline. You cannot cheat your way in.</p><br/>"

  "toxicTradingFlow": {
    "title": "Toxic Trading Flow",
    "content": "<p>“Toxic Trading Flow” refers to trading behaviours that exploit loopholes, manipulate execution, or create unsustainable results that do not represent genuine skill. Capital Chain reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, whether trading activity constitutes toxic flow. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p><br/><p><strong>Over-leverage</strong></p><p>Opening excessively large positions relative to account size, or engaging in trades with risk levels disproportionately high compared to account equity or margin tolerance. Using excessive leverage that results in overexposure or full margin utilization is strictly prohibited.</p><br/><p><strong>Maximum Lot Exposure (2-Step Master Accounts Only)</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Account Size</th><th>Maximum Lot Exposure</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>$25,000</td><td>10 lots</td></tr><tr><td>$50,000</td><td>20 lots</td></tr><tr><td>$100,000</td><td>40 lots</td></tr><tr><td>$5,000 / $10,000</td><td>No Limit</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This limit applies only to open trades at any given time (not as a daily cap). Once trades are closed, new trades may be opened again the same day. Profits from trades exceeding the lot exposure limit will be deducted.</p><br/><p><em>Guideline:</em> Any single trade larger than 20 lots on a $100,000 account will be considered over-leveraged and flagged by the Risk Team, regardless of the outcome.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> A trader with a $100,000 account opens a 50-lot EURUSD position. This represents more than 50% of the account’s effective margin capacity. Even if the trade is profitable, it will be disqualified for breaching the over-leverage rule.</p><br/><p><strong>Gambling behaviour</strong></p><p>Trading decisions made without any analysis or structured strategy (e.g., random entries, doubling lot sizes after losses (martingale), or revenge trading in an attempt to recover drawdowns).</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> After losing $2,000 across three trades, a trader blindly doubles the lot size on the next EURUSD trade without any setup. This reckless pattern is classified as gambling and prohibited.</p><br/><p><strong>Overtrading</strong></p><p>Opening an excessive number of trades within a day or week without a consistent system, often driven by FOMO or emotional reactions. As a guideline, more than 50 trades per day or 250 trades per week without a structured plan qualifies as overtrading. Risking cumulatively above 5% of equity through small random trades may also qualify.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> A trader with a $25,000 account opens more than 50 trades in a single day purely chasing the market — this is overtrading.</p><br/><p><strong>Latency arbitrage</strong></p><p>Exploiting delays between Capital Chain’s price feed and another broker or data source rather than genuine market analysis.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> If EURUSD rises 10 pips faster on Broker A than on Capital Chain, and a trader instantly opens a buy order on Capital Chain to capture the delayed price, this behaviour is considered latency arbitrage and is prohibited.</p><br/><p><strong>Reverse trading</strong></p><p>Simultaneously opening opposing positions across multiple accounts to eliminate risk and secure guaranteed profits on at least one side.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> Opening a 5-lot buy on GBPUSD in one funded account and a 5-lot sell in another funded account to guarantee a gain on one side is reverse trading and banned.</p><br/><p><strong>Tick scalping or HFT</strong></p><p>Extremely short-term trades designed to exploit micro-latency. As a rule of thumb, trades under 30 seconds in duration or more than 20 trades per minute intended to capture micro-movements fall under HFT/tick scalping and are prohibited.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> Placing 100 buy/sell orders on XAUUSD where each trade lasts under 30 seconds and targets 0.1–0.3 pips is tick scalping.</p><br/><p><strong>External account management</strong></p><p>Trading on behalf of third parties or mirroring across platforms. Any automated or manual mirroring of more than 30% of trades from an external source will be classified as external account management and is prohibited.</p><br/><p><em>Example:</em> Connecting a funded account to a trade-copying tool that executes trades from a master account on another broker directly violates this policy.</p><br/><p><strong>Consequences of Toxic Flow</strong></p><ul><li>First offence: Warning and review by the Risk Team.</li><li>Second offence: Immediate account closure, removal of profits, and permanent ban.</li></ul><br/>"
