<p>We offer Capital Chain Evaluation Programs in both Two-Phase and One-Phase models, each available in Normal and
    Atomic versions. To become a Master trader (funded trader), you must successfully pass the evaluation stage(s). It
    is crucial that you demonstrate a consistent trading system and strong risk management in order to pass. After you
    reach your profit target, your entire evaluation period will be manually reviewed by our Risk Team. This review
    process will be completed within two working days.</p> </br>
<p>In the event of a breach of any of the rules referred to in this section, all positions on the platform shall be
    closed immediately, the Customer’s Account will be closed, and the right to any reward will be revoked.</p>
<h3>2.1. The Student Phase (Two-Phase – Phase I)</h3>
<p>The Student Phase is designed to test your trading skills while defining your style as a trader. During the Student
    Phase, you must achieve a profit target of <strong>8%</strong> (e.g., $4,000 on a $50,000 account) without breaching
    any other rule and complete at least <strong>4 minimum trading days</strong>.</p>
<h3>2.2. The Practitioner Phase (Two-Phase – Phase II)</h3>
<p>The Practitioner Phase is designed to confirm the results and outcomes of the Student Phase. During this phase, you
    must achieve a profit target of <strong>5%</strong> without breaching any other rule and complete at least <strong>4
        minimum trading days</strong>.</p>
<h3>2.3. One-Phase Model (Normal/Atomic)</h3>
<p>In the One-Phase model, the trader must achieve a profit target of <strong>10%</strong> (e.g., $5,000 on a $50,000
    account) with a minimum of <strong>4 trading days</strong> while respecting all other rules.</p>
<h3>2.4. Maximum Daily Loss Limit</h3>
<p>The Maximum Daily Loss is the amount the trader is allowed to lose in a single day. For this rule, the higher value
    between equity and balance will be used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Two-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 5% of starting equity/balance.
    </li>
    <li><strong>One-Phase Accounts (Normal &amp; Atomic):</strong> Daily limit set to 3% of starting equity/balance.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example:</em> For a $100,000 account under the Two-Phase model, the maximum daily loss is $5,000. The equity of
    the day — which is the result of the currently floating PnL combined with all closed positions of that day — must
    not exceed this limit. The limit resets at 00:00 CE(S)T/server time each day.</p>
<h3>2.6. News Trading and Holding Over the Weekend</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>During the Evaluation (Student/Practitioner/One-Phase):</strong> You are allowed to hold trades over the
        weekend and trade during news events without restrictions.</li>
    <li><strong>During the Master Stage:</strong> News trading and holding positions overnight or over the weekend are
        fully allowed on all Capital Chain Master accounts. There are no restrictions on profits generated around
        high-impact news events.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.7. Trading Strategy</h3>
<p>You may trade the way you want. You are free to use Expert Advisors (EAs), hold during news, keep trades over the
    weekend, and trade lot sizes as large as leverage allows — as long as the trading activity does not fall under the
    prohibited categories:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Gap Trading:</strong> Entering trades immediately at market open to exploit weekend or session price
        gaps without any analytical basis. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD at the Sunday open solely because of a 20-pip
        gap.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Frequency Trading (HFT):</strong> Using algorithms or systems to place a very large number of
        trades within milliseconds to exploit execution speed. <em>Example:</em> Submitting hundreds of buy/sell orders
        in under a second to capture micro-ticks.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Spamming:</strong> Overloading the trading server with excessive order requests or modifications
        in a short period. <em>Example:</em> Repeatedly opening and closing dozens of orders per second to test latency
        or disrupt execution.</li>
    <li><strong>Latency Arbitrage:</strong> Exploiting differences between the Company’s price feed and another broker
        or data source. <em>Example:</em> Buying GBPUSD on Capital Chain when a faster feed shows higher prices
        elsewhere, solely to profit from the feed delay.</li>
    <li><strong>Toxic Trading Flow:</strong> As defined in Section 3.</li>
    <li><strong>Hedging Across Multiple Accounts:</strong> Opening opposing trades on two or more different accounts to
        eliminate risk. <em>Example:</em> Buying EURUSD on one funded account and selling the same size on another
        account to guarantee one profit regardless of direction. (Internal hedging within a single account is allowed.)
    </li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Arbitrage (Long-Short Arbitrage Simultaneously):</strong> Taking opposite positions on
        correlated instruments or brokers to exploit minor discrepancies. <em>Example:</em> Going long on US30 while
        going short on a correlated index solely to capture mispricing differences.</li>
    <li><strong>Tick Scalping:</strong> Opening and closing trades within seconds to exploit tiny bid/ask movements
        without strategy. <em>Example:</em> Opening 50 trades within one minute on XAUUSD to capture 0.1 pip movements
        repeatedly.</li>
    <li><strong>Copy Trading or Third-Party Account Management:</strong> Using another trader’s signals or managing
        external accounts by copying trades into Capital Chain accounts. <em>Example:</em> Mirroring trades from a
        master account on a different broker.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Using a third-party Expert Advisor is allowed only if it functions purely as a trade/risk
    manager. Any other type of automated trading EA is not permitted and will result in account closure.</p>
<p><strong>Remember!</strong> YOUR IDEAS, OUR RISK — To get funded and grow as a trader, you must demonstrate skill and
    discipline. You cannot cheat your way in.</p>
